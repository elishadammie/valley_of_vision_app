# Valley of Vision - Daily Prayer App

![Project Banner](https://www.centraloaks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/valley-of-vision-image-2.jpg)

A personal application designed to bring a moment of peace and reflection to your evening. This script extracts a prayer from the Puritan collection "The Valley of Vision," converts it to a soothing audio file using Text-to-Speech (TTS) technology, and delivers it daily.

## ‚ú® Features

* **PDF Text Extraction:** Parses prayers directly from the "Valley of Vision" PDF.
* **High-Quality TTS:** Converts prayer text into a deep, masculine, and soothing voice.
* **Automated Scheduling:** Designed to be run automatically at a set time each day.
* **Personal Delivery:** Sends the generated audio file for personal evening reflection.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.8+
* `pip` and `venv` (usually included with Python)

    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    * **On macOS/Linux:**

    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Set up your environment variables:**
    Copy the example file to a new `.env` file. This file will hold your secret keys and configurations.
